            <p>"We all know the classic "guessing game" with higher or lower prompts. lets do a role reversal; you create a program that will guess numbers between 1-100, and respond appropriately based on whether users say that the number is too high or too low. Try to make a program that can guess your number based on user input and great code!"</p>
            <div>
                <input type="button" onclick="guessingGame.guess(50)" value="Click the button when you have picked a value between 1 and 100"/>
            </div>
            <input type="button" onclick="guessingGame.higher()" value="The value I'm thinking of is higher"/>
            <input type="button"  onclick="guessingGame.lower()" value="The value I'm thinking of is lower"/>
            <div>
                <input type="button" onclick="guessingGame.correct()" value="You are correct!"/>
